			    	<p>A natural dye derived from the secretions of <span class="text-callout">predatory sea snails</span>, tyrian purple is thought to date as far back as the age of the Phoenicians in the 16th Century BC. Approximately 12,000 snails are needed to produce the amount of dye for one garment, and as such, the expensive color was historically worn as a symbol of status and wealth.</p>

					<p>Originating as far back as Greek and Roman antiquity, this pigment was derived from the green <span class="text-callout">crust that formed on copper plates</span> that would be boiled in sealed pots of vinegar. Verdigris was one of the most vibrant shades of green available until the 1800's, but is now much less popular because of its inherent toxicity. </p>
